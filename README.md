## [01 JavaScript Drum Kit](01_DrumKit/)
The JavaScript DrumKit adds event listeners to the window to react on keydown events, which then play the corresponding sound.

The key and audio elements are selected with the help of the querySelector method. In order to identify the individual key or audio element the elements data attribute is used.

## [02 JavaScript and CSS Clock](02_Clock/)
The JavaScript Clock uses setInterval to calculate and set the clock hands every second. It changes the rotation of the hands by setting the transform (style) property.

## [03 CSS Variables](03_CSS_Variables)
The defined CSS variables are manipulated via JavaScript. This changes the values everywhere the variables are used immediately, without the need of a page refresh.
